\title{
list association rules
}
\description{
This function finds association rules, filters them, and returns them in a table format.
}
\usage{
listAssociationRules(subgroup.data, support, confidence, top, filterby)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{subgroup.data}{
    A list containing the dataset, list of covariates, list of outcomes, the contrast, and control group (list)
  }
  \item{support}{
    the support for each rule, see arules (double) default is 0.1
  }
  \item{confidence}{
    the rule confidence, see arules (double) default is 0.5
  }
  \item{top}{
    the number of top rules to keep (integer) default is 10
  }
  \item{filterby}{
    the measure to filter the top by c("support", "confidence", "lift")
  }
  \item{onlyCovariates}{whether to exclude outcomes (logical) default=FALSE}
}
\details{
This can reveal higher coordinate relationships that the correlation matrix could not find. This function uses the 'inspect' from 'arules' package. See https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/arules/versions/1.6-3/topics/inspect
}
\value{
a table with LHS (left hand set), RHS (right hand set), support, confidence and lift columns and 'top' rows
}
